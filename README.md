<h1>Functions, nested loops</h1>

Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX. 
<h2> Purpose</h2>
It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in C language.
<h2>Technologies</h2>

    C files are compiled using gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 and chmod u+x
    C files are written in compliance with Betty coding styles
    Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

<h2>Files</h2>

<pre>
All of the following files are programs written in C:
Below is the summary of the filename and their brief description
0_putchar.c 	Prints _putchar
1-alphabet.c 	Prints the alphabet in lowercase
2-print_alphabet_x10.c 	Prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase
3-islower.c 	Checks for lowercase character
4-isalpha.c 	Checks for alphabetic character
5-sign.c 	Prints the sign of a number
6-abs.c 	Computes the absolute value of an integer
7-print_last_digit.c 	Prints the last digit of a number
8-24_hours.c 	Prints every minute of the day
9-times_table.c 	Prints the 9 times table, starting with 0
10-add.c 	Adds two integers and returns the result
11-print_to_98.c 	Prints all natural numbers from n to 98
100-times_table.c 	Prints the n times table, starting with 0
101-natural.c 	Computes and prints the sum of all the multiplies of 3 or 5 below 1024
102-fibonacci.c 	Prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
103-fibonacci.c 	Finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms
104-fibonacci.c 	Finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers
